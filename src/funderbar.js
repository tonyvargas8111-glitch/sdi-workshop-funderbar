//PART II

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
  Now you will start using logic to pass your tests. You will be using comparators to pass the tests.
*/
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------

//_.same takes two parameters and returns whether they are the equal or not
_.same = function(a,b){
  //Code Goes Below
  return a === b
}

//_.greater takes two numbers as parameters and checks if a is greater than b
_.greater = function(a,b){
  //Code Goes Below
  return a > b
}

//_.lessThan takes two numbers as parameters and checks if a is less than b
_.lessThan = function(a,b){

//_.falsyOrTruthy takes a parameter and determines whether it is TRUTHY or FALSY
_.falsyOrTruthy = function(a){
   //Code Goes Below
   return !!a
}

  //In the next tests you will be given four parameters to compare, sort of.
  //You will be given a, b, c, and d. Within your function you will compare 
  //a to b as well as comparing c to d. You will then compare their outcomes with
  //each other using the && or || logic to return true or false. 
  //EXAMPLE 3 > 2 && 5 === 6
  //The above example will evaluate to False because 3 > 2 === True and 5 === 6 False,
  // as you learned in the Learn content True && False evaluates to False.
  //For the _.andAnd function as well as the _.oror function you will just be using the === comparator

  //_.andAnd will be using the && comparator
  _.andAnd = function(a,b,c,d) {
  //Code Goes Below

    _.forIfElseStr = function(a){

    //In this function you will loop though the passed in array. Prior to that you need to check the second parameter to determine what you will be returning. 
    //If the second parameter is 'string' return a sentence created using the strings in the array. If the second parameter is 'number' you will return the total of the number in the array.
